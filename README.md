# Discord "Game Engine"
A game engine using discord's Official Unofficial .NET API to make bots (discord.net)

This project was inspired by a video from someone on Reddit and or Youtube : https://youtu.be/0fWdU8JCT6Y

Though this bot will add games and enable people to create their own discord interactive programs based on its framework, and EnderEngine itself (see below), it will also be a moderation bot for our own servers, or even yours if you customize them.

## Main features

# How to use :

> Will be documented later

## Dependencies (included in the release Folder, if you want to compile it by yourself, you need to add the references to the project) :
- [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)
    
  Discord.Net is the main C# API to create bots for discord, it is widely used, and really useful.
- [EnderEngine 0.1.0](https://github.com/Nothender/EnderEngine) (Not released yet, might not be accessible as the repository is for instance private)

  EnderEngine is our own Engine developpement project (which we are doing mainly for fun and experience, but also for projects like these):
  * Ender engine will allow us to implement a lot of features really quickly and easely, or even make them again (FrameBuffer, Logging, Physics, AI, etc...)
  * Ender Engine is an actual engine in which we can make games/apps, and as the point of this project, is to be able to create playable games In discord it will simply save us a ton of time because of all these features we already programmed in it.
